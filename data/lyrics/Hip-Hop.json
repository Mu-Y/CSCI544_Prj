we was livin' in\nTaught me how to save my little dividends\nSo when I graduated I'd have a little school money\nBut in the sixth grade I wanted to be the school dummy\nAnd flunked outta school with the flag pole\nAnd left my mother dear at home with a sad soul\nBecause my mother worked the fingers to the bone\nCause we was alone, and me I bought an F home\nMy real pops he broke out with the style\nSo I respect my stepdad, for raisin' another nigga's child\nSo now we livin' comftable\nTaught me the game and how to be responsible\nBut back then I couldn't see it\nI wanted to be a grown man at fourteen so the kid's leavin'\nAnd ended up in a big fight\nAnd told me not to come home until I got my shit right\nSo now I'm livin' in my grandma's home\nMy grandma's strong, she's got nine kids of her own\nAnd keepin' me ain't no big deal\nBut now that I'm much older I see just how the shit feels\nBeing kind-hearted, not wantin' to tell me no\nEven though my grandfather just had a stroke\nAnd now the money's low\nAnd pretty soon a brother's gonna have ta go\nOr either try to find a job so I can help out\nI'm in the ghetto, I gots ta get myself out\nAnd when I get out I gotta try to pave the way\nSo my family can have a better place to stay\nI'm losin' all hope, a brother's fallin' short\nI can't cope, so now I'm slangin' dope\nAnd now my granny knows I'm doin' wrong\nShe

day\nA star's born, let's name him little Scarface\nMy first born and yo I'm a proud father\nI gotta son, I gots ta be my son's father\nAnd sellin dope ain't the way that I can get ahead\nBut what the hell, I gots ta keep my baby fed\nI buy him milk, and pampers tryin ta do my part\nAnd he's my son, I gots ta try to make him hard\nI buy him clothes, and jewellry not the Tonka toys\nBecause the Tonka toys will only punk my boy\nAnd I don't want my son to look at life\nThrough a replica of reality tryin' to make it life-like\nBut yet and still I let my son be a kid\nJust give him up the real, exactly like my momma did\nSo when he gets to be a man he'll appreciate\nThe game I gave him way back when he used to roller skate\nAnd now my son is four years old\nI really gots ta give the real and try to play the father's role\nBecause these years he'll remember most\nSo it's all about little Marcus and me becomin' close\nBut I got a buncha obstacles\nIf it ain't my line of work it's the girlies on my popsicle\nNow everybody's got my baby\nWantin' to have their hands in my pocket tryin to drive me crazy\n\"It's your daughter, don't she look like you?\"\nI just can't tell, why don't you take it to ma momma do\nBecause my mother knows the real deal\nAll these hoochies poppin' coochie tryin' to get a free meal\nSo now we in and outta cope\nTryin' to get mo money, braggin' om the

daddy\nAnd biological tests can prove\nYou gotta get up off of me and go after the other dude\nBut now I finally got a real daughter\nNo need for the testin'\nI know that I'm the baby's father\nI heard my daddy say them hoes will try ta kill ya\nYou couldn't have told me nothin' back then\nBut now I feel ya...\n\nI feel ya...\n\nNow I'm twenty-two and finally got a grip on life\nIt's nineteen ninety-three, I put away my pocket knife\nAnd got a bigger stick to fight with\nI'm young and black so my choice ain't a nightstick\nBecause we livin' in a concentration set\nAnd everyday, we face to face with death\nI seen my homies go and come\nAnd judgement day is just somethin we can't run from\nSo I know my number's comin' up\nSo I gotta protect myself from suckers who be runnin' up\nAnd even

fight the beast\nSo united we stand but we gonna fall quick\nBecause we always tryin to take another brother's shit\nAnd the cops is in the same vote\nJust because we comin' up quick they think we slang dope\nThey shootin' ta kill, they gas ain't sparkin' goods\nThey shot my long time partner Rudy in cold blood\nAnd now the story's all twisted up\nAnd if they gave the cop the chair\nI really wouldn't give a fuck\nBecause she left my partner's family with memories\nAnd after hearin' this I know you gon' remember me\nBut yet in still I find it hard for me to stay in touch\nI see his parents and then I started breakin' up\nBecause I know what you did was wrong\nBut you won't realize until you dead and gone\nIt ain't no justifiable homicide, you never gave a warning\nYou straight up shot him from behind\nBut all the cryin' in the world ain't gonna bring him back\nYou give a gat to a black he don't know how to act\nBut you gotta tell your story to the judge\nNot the imitation judge, the judge that everybody loves\nAnd if the man upstairs grants you forgiveness\nThen in reality you took care of your business\nBut regardless I know you wanna kill me\nBut I ain't goin' out like
