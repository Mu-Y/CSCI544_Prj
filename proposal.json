    "Music lives forever. Along with audio, lyrics convey the spirits of artists, in a way that they can better reflect the unique style and characteristics of the author. Imagine this, after being exposed to a large set of lyrics examples, a machine can learn to write lyrics just like John Lennon. It allows us to reproduce or even revive the spirits of the artists we love. Also, if trained appropriately, it is possible for the machine to automatically generate lyrics for different sections of a song, e.g. verse, chorus, hook, or even an entire song of a specific genre. This can provide inspiration for human song writers."
